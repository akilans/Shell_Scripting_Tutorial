SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is

              in a long listing, don't print group names

       -h, --human-readable
              with -l and/or -s, print human readable sizes (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       -l     use a long listing format

       -L, --dereference
              when showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for the file the link references rather than for the link
              itself

       -m     fill width with a comma separated list of entries

       -n, --numeric-uid-gid

       -S     sort by file size, largest first

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with  -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time: atime or access or use (-u); ctime or status (-c); also use
              specified time as sort key if --sort=time (newest first)

       --time-style=STYLE
              with -l, show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT; FORMAT is interpreted like in 'date';  if
              FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files; if STYLE is prefixed
              with 'posix-', STYLE takes effect only outside the POSIX locale

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time,  newest
              first

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -Z, --context
              print any security context of each file

       -1     list one file per line.  Avoid '\n' with -q or -b

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  SIZE  argument  is  an  integer  and  optional  unit  (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or
       KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits  color  codes
       only  when standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircol‐
       ors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

NAME
     cal, ncal — displays a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-3hjy] [-A number] [-B number] [[month] year]
     cal [-3hj] [-A number] [-B number] -m month [year]
     ncal [-3bhjJpwySM] [-A number] [-B number] [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-3bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [year]
     ncal [-CN] [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of
     Easter.  The new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 terminal.  If arguments are not specified, the current
     month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal number, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays the same month of the
             following or previous year respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Gregorian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal
             tries to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and
             her colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2 -A2” shows everything from November of the previous year to
             February of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11” simply shows the next 12 months.

     -B number
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to the beginning of the display. See -A for examples.

     -C      Switch to cal mode.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selection).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlighting).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not display a
     calendar for 1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated
     name as specified by the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current system clock and time zone (so “cal -m 8”
     will display a calendar for the month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3, and -1 are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options are
     given, the later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  The ncal command appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.6.  The output of the cal command is supposed
     to be bit for bit compatible to the original Unix cal command, because its output is processed by other programs like CGI scripts,
     that should not be broken. Therefore it will always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain data. This extra blank line also appears
     with the original cal command, at least on Solaris 8

AUTHORS
     The ncal command and manual were written by Wolfgang Helbig <helbig@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     The assignment of Julian–Gregorian switching dates to country codes is historically naive for many countries.

     Not all options are compatible and using them in different orders will give varying results.

NAME
       firefox - a free and open source web browser from Mozilla

SYNOPSIS
       firefox [OPTIONS] [url]

DESCRIPTION
       See http://support.mozilla.com/ for help using the browser.  This manpage only describes how to run it.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Prints the command line options.

       -g, --debug
              Starts firefox in a debugger.

       -d, --debugger
              Specify the debugger in which to start firefox. The default is gdb. Used in conjunction with -g.

       -a, --debugger-args
              Specify arguments to pass to the debugger. Used in conjunction with -g.

       -no-remote
              Don't  connect  to any other running instances of firefox. Use this if you want to run firefox in an entirely new process. By
              default, firefox will delegate a command to an already running instance.

       -ProfileManager
              Start the profilemanager. Use this to choose the profile you would like to run firefox  with.  You  will  need  to  also  use
              -no-remote if there is already a running firefox instance.

       -P profile
              Start  firefox  with  the profile named profile. Will start the profile manager if a valid profile name is not specified. You
              will need to also use -no-remote if there is already a running firefox instance.

       -safe-mode
              Start firefox in safe-mode. This disables all third-party extensions, and may be necessary if you are having problems with an
              extension you installed.

       -new-tab url
              Open url in a new tab.

       -new-window url
              Open url in a new window.

       -v, -version
              Print the current version of firefox.

       -UILocale locale
              Start firefox with the specified locale locale. Use this to override your environment

       -preferences
              Open the preferences dialog.

       -private
              Start firefox in private browsing mode

       -private-toggle
              Toggle private browsing mode

       -setDefaultBrowser
              Set firefox as the default web browser

       -search term
              Search for term with your default search engine

       -jsconsole
              Open the Error console. If firefox is not already running, this will open a new browser window too

firefox                                                          2011-02-09                                                      FIREFOX(1)
